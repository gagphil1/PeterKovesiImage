# Peter Kovesi's functions for image processing

This is a very usefull Matlab library for image processing from Peter Kovesi (https://www.peterkovesi.com/matlabfns/index.html).

## What this repo is about

I made this repo to keep a uptodate version in MatlabFns.

* To install, you only have to copy the folder MatlabFns on your computer, and run matlabfns_setup.m to update the Matlab path.
* type matlabfns_doc to display a local version of the html docs.
